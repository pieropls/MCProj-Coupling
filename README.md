# Coupling

- **Project Title**: *Coupling 2 probability distributions with high probability of equality*
- **Course**: Simulation and Monte Carlo Methods (2nd Semester, ENSAE Paris)
- **Authors**: Piero PELOSI, Omar EL MAMOUNE, Sarakpy NY

## üß™ Project Overview

This project explores how to construct a **joint distribution** $(X,Y)$ for two given probability distributions $p$ and $q$ such that:
   - $X \sim p$, $Y \sim q$
   - $\mathbb{P}(X = Y)$ is made as large as possible

Our work is based on the ideas from the paper [*The Coupled Rejection Sampler*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09585) by Adrien Corenflos and Simo S√§rkk√§ (2022). We compare the proposed approach (the **Coupled Rejection Sampler** and its **Ensemble** variant) with a simpler but classical approach, **Thorisson‚Äôs algorithm** (Appendix I in the paper).

We also investigate the computational properties (e.g., running time, variance of the algorithm‚Äôs run time) in different scenarios:
- Coupling multivariate Gaussian distributions (including the case of different covariance matrices).
- Varying dimension.
- Considering potential random-walk Metropolis experiments (Section 5.3 of the paper).

The ultimate goal is to see how these coupling algorithms perform in practice and to gain insight into the pros and cons of each method.

The **Simulation and Monte Carlo Methods** course at ENSAE Paris focuses on techniques for **stochastic simulation** and their application to **statistics, machine learning, finance, and other domains**. Topics covered:
   - Monte Carlo integration and variance reduction techniques (e.g., antithetic variables, control variates).
   - Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for Bayesian inference.
   - Importance Sampling and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods.
   - Applications to statistical inference, optimization, and financial engineering.
   - Implementation and analysis of simulation algorithms for high-dimensional problems.
